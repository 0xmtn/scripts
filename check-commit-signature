# check-commit-signature
# ----------------------
# A server-side update git hook for checking the GPG signature of a pushed
# commit.
#
# To enable this hook, rename this file to "update".
#
# Config
# ------
# hooks.allowunsignedcommits
#   This boolean sets whether unsigned tags, and merges with unsigned commits
#   into master, are allowed. By default, they are not allowed.
# hooks.allowcommitsonmaster
#   This boolean sets whether non-merge commits are allowed on master. By
#   default, these are not allowed.
# hooks.allowhotfixonmaster
#   The boolean sets whether branches beginning with hotfix-* are allowed on
#   master. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. CURRENTLY IGNORED.
# hooks.allowunannotated
#   This boolean sets whether unannotated tags will be allowed into the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletetag
#   This boolean sets whether deleting tags will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.allowmodifytag
#   This boolean sets whether a tag may be modified after creation. By default
#   it won't be.
# hooks.allowdeletebranch
#   This boolean sets whether deleting branches will be allowed in the
#   repository.  By default they won't be.
# hooks.denycreatebranch
#   This boolean sets whether remotely creating branches will be denied
#   in the repository.  By default this is allowed.
